**Objective:**
The objective of the code is to generate individual HTML reports displaying the overall count of COVID-19 cases for different states. The data is sourced from a CSV file, and the generated HTML reports include a line chart illustrating the daily new cases for each state.

**Components:**
1. **Data Source:**
   - A CSV file (`cases_state.csv`) serves as the data source, containing information about COVID-19 cases, including state-wise data and dates.

2. **Libraries Used:**
   - The code utilizes several Python libraries, including:
     - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
     - `matplotlib` for creating data visualizations, specifically line charts.
     - `mpld3` for converting the matplotlib plot to HTML format.
     - `base64` and `BytesIO` for encoding and handling image data.

3. **Process Overview:**
   - The user is prompted to input a state for which the COVID-19 data needs to be visualized.
   - The code reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - State-specific data is filtered from the DataFrame based on the user input.
   - A line chart is generated using matplotlib, depicting the daily new cases over time.
   - The chart is saved as an image in memory, encoded in base64 format.
   - The base64-encoded image is embedded in an HTML template using mpld3's `fig_to_html` function.
   - The generated HTML content is saved to a file named after the selected state.

4. **Styling:**
   - The HTML reports include a simple style setting, ensuring a clean and readable display.
   - The image within the HTML is styled to be responsive and fit the width of the container.

5. **Automation:**
   - The code can be extended for automation by reading a list of states from a text file (`states.txt`) and generating individual HTML reports for each state. This is suitable for daily updates.

**Usage:**
   - The user can run the script, input a state, and the code will generate an HTML report displaying the COVID-19 cases graph for the selected state.
   - For bulk processing, the list of states can be maintained in a text file, and the script can be automated to generate reports for all states.
